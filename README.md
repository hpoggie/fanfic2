### _Henry Poggie <henry.poggie@gmail.com>_

This is a rewrite of my original bad fanfic finding script in Common Lisp. The
purpose of it is to get better at Lisp.

## Running it

```
docker run -d aircontrol/fanfic2
```

This will probably take several days. I had to throttle the request rate to stay within ff.net terms of service.
